# Train-Scheduler

<p>Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:</p>
<p>When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:</p>
<li>
  <ul>Train Name</ul>
  <ul>Destination</ul>
  <ul>First Train Time -- in military time</ul>
  <ul>Frequency -- in minutes</ul>
</li>
<p>Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.</p>
<p>Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.</p>
<p>Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!</p>
